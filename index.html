<p>This is just about things I'd like to talk about.</p>
<p>My favorite songs/bands are Peppermint Winter by Owl City and this guy called TheFatRat.I like the song Echo as well.</p><p>My favorite dinner is my Mam's Spaghetti and Meat-balls and my Dad's Home-Made Pizza.</p>

<p>I like playing this game called Roblox.Most of my friends play/know it.<p/><p>I always have trouble with time-tables.Can anyone else relate?I always get stuck at times 8.</p>

<p>My favorite colour is light sky blue and a light green and orange.I don't like water-melon but I like grape-fruit and I don't put sugar on it.I also like oranges!</p>

<p>I am not allergic to anything but my friend is allergic to nuts.I don't think he ever had a reaction but maybe!</p>

<p>I am trying to find out how how to let people talk and ask questions and let people make Accounts.</p>

<p>I really like reading and one of my favorite books is called Inkheart by Cornelia Funke.I like the Harry Potter Series too.My friend told me about the Grindlewood books.The author came to our school!!!Her name is Jackie Burke.</p>

I was listening to Echo,Alone and Snail's House(I think that's the name).<p>I like these guys called Crusher-P and Fandroid on Youtube.</p>

<p>I really wanna get a Nintendo Switch and play Skyrim.It seems like a really good game!</p>

<p>The reason I made this and called this The Daily Howler was because I read this book about wolves called The Wolf Wilder.
I like reading quite a lot.I've been reading (the GONE series I think it's called?)this book called Hunger(The sequal to GONE).
It's really good!</p>

<p>I've also been reading His Dark Materials(The name of the Series).It has magic and mystery and great Characters!</p>

<p>This is gonna be it for a while.Just me talking.About...stuff.</p>
  <p>There is a book called The Fault In Our Stars.I have never read a book that touched me so deeply.It's by John Green.He's written many other books as well.He's a great Author.</p>
  <p>My favourite movies are the Hunger Games movies.THEY'RE SO GOOD!:-D I really recommend them.They are a  bit gory/violent.BUT THEY'RE GOOD so...Watch them!>_< </p>
    <p>Okay.Portal.MY FAVORITE GAME EVER!It just messes with your head and GlaDOS is so smart and and so sneaky!It has a great mystery behind it!
  <p>You might see from the profile picture and the name of this page that I like wolves.They're so sleek and fast and sneaky and strong.I want to meet a tame wolf in the wild.</p>
  <p>I really like to draw but I am not that good at all.I can't draw anything really.There's a girl in my class who's really good at drawing(Gonna protect her identity).</p>
